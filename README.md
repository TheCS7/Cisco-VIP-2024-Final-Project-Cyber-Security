# **College Campus Network Topology Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project involves creating and analyzing the network topology of a college campus using Cisco Packet Tracer. The analysis includes mapping the network infrastructure, identifying vulnerabilities, and proposing security solutions.

## **Files in the Repository**

- **Campus_Network_vip_24.pkt**: Cisco Packet Tracer file with network topology and embedded notes.
- **README.md**: This file.

## **Network Topology**

- **Components**: Routers, switches, firewalls, servers, workstations, wireless access points.
- **Segments**: Administrative, academic, and public networks.

## **Attack Surface Mapping**

- **Entry Points**: Physical, wireless, remote access.
- **Security Measures**: Firewalls, WPA3 encryption, regular updates.
- **Vulnerabilities**: Unpatched software, weak passwords, misconfigurations.

## **Security Assessment Report**

### **Introduction**

Analyzes network topology, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes security enhancements.

### **Key Points**
